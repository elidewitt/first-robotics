# first-robotics
In high school, I was the strategy team lead for FIRST Robotics Competition Team 93. I developed some scouting solutions applications which can be found here.

When developing these applications, I discovered that I don't like making website forms from scratch. It felt like I was just repeating myself over and over. So, I made a script to build it for me! The information to be generated goes into a JavaScript object, and then some JavaScript code loops through it and generates all the HTML elements. 
The first few iterations got the job done, and later iterations optimized for usability on tablets. I'm proud of what I came up with my senior year in 2022. See it here: https://elidewitt.github.io/first-robotics/2022-rapid-react/field-scouting/
